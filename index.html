		<!-- The view is the div element and everything inside it. The div element contains the ng-controller attribute

		<div ng-controller="HelloController">

		// The HomeController function is simply a normal JS function. In Angular, it is registered using 
		// angular.module(...).controller(...)
		// The below code creates an angular module named "myApp" and assigns it to a variable "app". Notice that
		// the name "myApp" matches the name specified in the ng-app attribute. The empty brackets tell Angular to create 
		// the module and register it.
		var app = angular.module("myApp", []);


		// Using the "app" variable, the controller is then registered to the "myApp" module using the code below. 
		app.controller("HelloController", function($scope) {

			// Finally, a member variable named "message" on the object $scope is set to "Hello World." 
			// Placing this variable on scope ensures that Angualr will be able to use it in the Angular expression.

<!-- Once run in the browser, you should see "Hello World". Here is an explanation of what is happening when the 
application is run in the browser:
1. The HTML document is loaded and evaluated. 
2. The AngularJS JavaScript file is loaded and executed, creating the Angular global object.
3. The JavaScript that creates the "myApp" module and registers the "HomeController" controller function is executed.
4. Angular scans the HTML looking for Angular apps and views. If Angular finds a view, it connects that view to the 
specified controller function
5. Angular executes the controller functions and updates the views with data from the model populated by the controller.
At this point, the HTML page is ready to be displayed.
6. Angular now listens for browser events (mouse movement, button clicks, keyboard entry, etc) and if any of the
events would require a view to change, Angular updates the view accordingly.-->
